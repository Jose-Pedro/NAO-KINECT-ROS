Description: <p>
              Python implementation of the driver package for the Naoqi robot, providing access to walking commands,
              joint angles, and sensor data (odometry, IMU, ...). The
              most-current version is compatible with the Nao API version 1.12 or newer,
              connecting to a real or simulated Nao by wrapping Aldebaran Robotics'
              NaoQI API in Python. This requires the &quot;lib&quot; directory of the Aldebaran
              Python SDK to be in your PYTHONPATH environment variable.
        
              Note that cameras drivers are provided in a separate package (naoqi_sensors_py).
